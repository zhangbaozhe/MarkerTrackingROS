# ECE4310 Project 1

Basic ideas

Why I choose use TODO this approch?
- what is my considerations?
- is this approach robust?

## Finite state machine

- NAV_ROAD: the robot is on the major road of the navigation
- EXPLORE: the robot needs new target to feed
- DELIVERING: the robot is within certain distance with the target
- EXIT: delivering is finished, need to go back to the position where the robot starts to deliver
